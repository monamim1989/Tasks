Marlabs has set the bar up high through our Campus Recruitment Programs. Our training center based at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania helps new hires hone their skills. Training in cutting edge technologies combined with continuous learning and mentoring help them stay at the forefront of technology.

We hire a number of graduate and undergraduate students every year, mainly through the several career fairs we attend throughout the year. We hire students from universities across the US and train them on the latest technologies.  Our approach takes care of both functional as well as technological aspects of a job, which differentiates us from other companies. We groom our graduates to overcome cultural barriers and grow to their full potential. Marlabs is well-known to provide the best on-site in-class training and placements.
